PREREQUISITES:

- Cassandra 1.1
- Hadoop 1.0.1+
- Pig 0.10

1. Open the pig_cassandra script and set the environment variables to match your local environment

2. Some package managers install the pig binary in /usr/bin and the jars in /usr/share/pig. If this is the case
   you will need to create /usr/share/pig/bin and copy the pig binary there.

3. To run in a local environment (i.e. non-cluster) run "./pig_cassandra -x local average.pig"
